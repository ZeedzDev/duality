This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project

# Preamble

This project was created for a Multimedia Assessment, and was rushed. Best practices were attempted to be followed in most cases, but I haven't had time to go back and refactor the code to make it more readable. I also haven't had time to write tests or anything so unlucky I guess. For example, in some instances I properly use context, and others I just pass props down components because I was lazy.

# If you wanted to understand project structure

Project follows general Next app directory structure, structured by `create-next-app`. Icons are located inside the `/public/icons/` folder, and code is located inside the `/src` folder, with next routing inside the `/src/app` directory.

Components, context, styling, types, and utils are all located inside the `/src` folder, followed by that section. Sorry if the code isn't as readable as it could have. Comments just took too long to write and my imagination when it comes to naming is... limited.

# Hosting
